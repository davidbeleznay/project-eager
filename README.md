This notebook is a demonstration of the end-to-end workflow described in the paper 
[EEAGER: A neural network model for finding beaver complexes in satellite and aerial imagery](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JG007196). 
This notebook is for reproducability of the model described in the paper and any data or models used are purely for demonstration purposes. 
The workflow requires access to training data (latitude and longitude coordinates and a date) and high-resolution imagery, 
high enough resolution to see beaver habitat.
